        <p><b>In literary theory, a text is any object that can be "read", whether this object is a work of literature, a street sign, an arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of clothing. It is a set of signs that is available to be reconstructed by a reader if sufficient interpretants are available.</b></p>

        <p><b>What is a basic definition of text? Text is the exact, original words written by an author. Text is also a specific work as written by the original author. Text is also commonly used to refer to a text message or to send a text message. Text has several other senses as a noun.</b></p>

     <h3>my third website</h3>
     <p><b>Traditionally, a text is understood to be a piece of written or spoken material in its primary form (as opposed to a paraphrase or summary). A text is any stretch of language that can be understood in context. It may be as simple as 1-2 words (such as a stop sign) or as complex as a novel.</b></p>
